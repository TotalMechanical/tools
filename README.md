# FOREMAN TOOL TRACKER

The Tool Tracker gives foremen at [Total Mechanical](https://totalmechanical.com), a Vancouver, WA-based construction company, a mobile-first web experience for viewing, reporting, and requesting tools from the central shop while onsite at a job. The shop manages all the tools, tracking, and reporting through Airtable, which acts as the backend. The front-end is built with React, React Router and styled using Bootstrap / Reactstrap. The front-end is deployed on Vercel and consumes the shopâ€™s Airtable API.
